    <h1>SCHOOL YEARBOOK COVER</h3>
    <p>I was honored to be selected to design the yearbook cover for the 2019-2020 school year. Since our school mascot is the tiger, and we are famous for having a beautiful sunset, I decided to combine the two and design a cover with a unique cut-out effect and having the gradient on the sheet underneath so the colors could show through. Because of publishing issues, the original design was modified.</p>
    <p>Created with: Adobe Illustrator for graphics, Adobe
         Photoshop for drawing and photo editing</p>
