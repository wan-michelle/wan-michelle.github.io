			<p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 20px; background-color: azure">A-third through the reading of "As We May Think", I was confused to why Vannevar Bush never mentioned any modern technology, I scrolled up to check the date and found out it was a 1945 issue, which really put me into perspective of someone in living in the age before the technological developmental phase. As a person who was born in the 21st century, seeing Bush writing so passionately about technologies that are almost obsolete and unheard of is astonishing, especially when he talked about photography. We take photography, and anything technological, for granted- the way a photo can be easily taken with a button on a phone, and how film cameras were only back in trend because it is "aesthetic". I would consider Bush as a visionary. But even so, his wildest imagination of a device that can store everything with fast speed and flexibility ("memex") cannot compare to the technological advances of a smartphone. It is interesting to me that when we imagine the future, we always imagine with the technology we already have but the method of display is slightly improved. For example, Bush's memex considers the desk as the device and tries to implement uses but it still uses microfilms.</p>

			<p style="font-family: courier; font-size: 20px; background-color: lavender">The creation of the web, explained by the article written by Tim Berners-Lee, established something that has never been seen before in the history. It had given people freedom to publish things online from all over the world, and most importantly, one of the most important factors- decentralization. However, the "serendipitous creations" comes with its inevitable dangers, when search engines becomes a monopoly, when certain web gets a better treatment than others while paying the same amount, when companies or countries utilize the web to "wiretap" or snoop through personal information. This made me think about the way we are using the web right now. Because our information is so easily taken and hackable, people could always use these to their advantage, like targeted advertising, or even taking covid data to warn about exposure would endanger someone's freedom. </p>
